/* Amazing JS library
 Very simple library but the ecosystem is very big ==> Redux, webpack, babel
 Concentrate on Pure React
 Focus on React fundamentals and how do they work
 Component based architecture ==> UI / View ek component k andar hai

 - Class (syntactic sugar on constructor function) component
 - render method ==> compiled JS into function
 - CRA is a CLI to create a project and run 
 - it requires npm and for that u need to download node
 - CRA behind the scene runs webpack, webpack dev server run karega
 
 - 2 packages: 1. React 2. React DOM ==> React renders on different places like React Native renders on phone 
 - component create krk ussko DOM men daalna zaruri hai
 - render method accepts 2 things: 1. which component 2. where to render
 - used to new syntax
 - constructor pattern is syntactic sugar
